00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.116
PAJARITO: Good morning Steven
— What’s up man?

2
00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:06.987
— How’s it going?
—Great, great.

3
00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:10.823
— Good morning!
— What’s up, son?

4
00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:14.136
PAJARITO: <i>Don</i> Héctor, good morning.
— How’s it going man?

5
00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.225
DON HÉCTOR:
You still got good eye, huh

6
00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:21.603
PAJARITO:
Well I have to pick the best, because clients are demanding. Clients are…

7
00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:23.611
…You gotta keep your head in the game.

8
00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.714
We have to sell these no matter what.

9
00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:29.699
It takes strength!

10
00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:32.100
PAJARITO:
God bless you <i>Don</i> Héctor, thank you very much.

11
00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.303
— Amen son, good luck my brother.
— Okay.

12
00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:40.303
— Steven!
STEVEN: See you later, son.

13
00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:41.995
PAJARITO:
God bless you, thanks brother.

14
00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.512
PAJARITO:
You gotta earn your bread working.

15
00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.534
That’s the heritage my parents left me: to work, work, and work.

16
00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:50.944
Working is good.

17
00:00:56.764 --> 00:01:02.205
PAJARITO:
I work with Medellín's soccer team logistics, I sell movies,
and I work with the loan agency.

18
00:01:02.538 --> 00:01:06.164
Oh, and the lemons. That means I have four jobs.

19
00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:13.764
PAJARITO:
<i>I sell you, sell you, sell you, I sell you even love…

20
00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:17.764
<i>…In easy monthly installments, but without financing.

21
00:01:18.097 --> 00:01:21.841
<i>I sell you, sell you, sell you, I sell you this song,

22
00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:28.132
<i>and for only ten cents…I sell you my song.

23
00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:44.967
PAJARITO:
<i>We have loans for pensioners, and also for retirees. Even if you are reported…

24
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.457
PAJARITO:
<i>Credit, loans! We refinance debts, we buy your portfolio…

25
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.437
<i>What a beautiful girl, what a gorgeous girl…

26
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.701
<i>…She must be </i>paisa <i>to be that stunning.

27
00:02:08.908 --> 00:02:12.790
MAN: Do you work with the Military Forces Retirement Fund?
— Of course, we work with…look.

28
00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:14.924
— We work with the…
— The Retirement Fund.

29
00:02:15.257 --> 00:02:17.309
—Sure.
— Where are you located?

30
00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:19.924
— In that building over there
— Are you open right now?

31
00:02:20.257 --> 00:02:21.626
— Of course.
— Okay, thanks.

32
00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.539
— Can you come with me?
— Yeah.

33
00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:25.088
— Okay, let’s go.
— Let’s go.

34
00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:26.966
This way, this way, my friend.

35
00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:38.819
— How are the rates over there?
— Very low. They will do a credit background check…

36
00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:42.396
…it doesn’t take long. They do the credit background check in five minutes, and…

37
00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:46.078
Brother, to tell you the truth, I like to be honest.

38
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:49.168
Some people will tell you that it’ll take five minutes, or an hour, no.

39
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.829
You know this goes all the way to Bogotá…
— But you work with this, so…

40
00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:56.359
That’s what I’m saying, you'll get your money in three days. In around three days.

41
00:02:56.692 --> 00:02:58.269
— So, on Saturday?
— Right…

42
00:02:58.602 --> 00:03:03.572
PAJARITO:
That’s your mission: not just hand out the flyers,
but delivering a well-informed leaflet.

43
00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:07.959
For example look: this man noticed and asked where to go, so I brought him,

44
00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:13.539
and now Luisa fills him in, so, you feel fulfilled and you say “I’m gonna get another one”.

45
00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:15.784
So, you feel motivated. You say “I’m going for another one”.

46
00:03:17.232 --> 00:03:19.269
PAJARITO:
Music, movies, videos!

47
00:03:19.602 --> 00:03:21.646
Videos, movies, music!

48
00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:25.232
The Bite of the Piranha Woman..!

49
00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:33.161
PAJARITO:
Some of us sell them, others buy them…We’re all salesmen. We sell an image.

50
00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:35.022
Volume!

51
00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:37.038
PAJARITO:
You gotta please people, am I right?

52
00:03:37.371 --> 00:03:38.576
— God bless you!
— All right.

53
00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.419
Have a nice day. Okay.

54
00:03:42.247 --> 00:03:43.629
PAJARITO:
Music, music!

55
00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:47.549
WOMAN: How much?
— Cheap. One for 2000 pesos, three for 5000 pesos, lady!

56
00:03:48.345 --> 00:03:50.751
Look, I have great music here. Look.

57
00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.115
PAJARITO:
<i>Too bad you’re not mine…</i> [Popular song]

58
00:03:54.448 --> 00:03:58.204
<i>And I can’t give you the best of my soul…

59
00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:05.012
<i>…Too bad I’m late…And I forgot the words...I’ll sing it to you later…

60
00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.478
WOMAN:
Keep singing, I liked your voice.

61
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:11.149
That’s why I’m so entertained here.

62
00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:13.182
PAJARITO: Really?
— Of course, sing for me some more.

63
00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:15.970
— I liked it.
— I like you too.

64
00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:21.079
— Sing for me some more!
— What do you want me to sing?

65
00:04:21.412 --> 00:04:24.428
Something by José Luis Perales.
PAJARITO: Oh!

66
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:26.234
You don’t know any?
PAJARITO: Yes, wait.

67
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:30.366
— <i>You call me to say you’re leaving…</i>
— Oh, I love it.

68
00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.159
<i>…That you can’t take it anymore.

69
00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:37.420
<i>That you’re sick of seeing him everyday…

70
00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:44.881
<i>…of sharing his bed. Tired of football Sundays, of life at home…

71
00:04:45.214 --> 00:04:50.123
<i>…And you take the street…looking for love…

72
00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:52.874
I have no music.

73
00:04:55.388 --> 00:04:56.761
Bravo!

74
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:02.210
Excellent, excellent. Honestly, I don’t want to let you go.

75
00:05:02.773 --> 00:05:07.322
— I sing, but with the shouting your voice gets damaged.
— Yeah, but you sing very well, really.

76
00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.412
I wanna hire you to sing for me here every afternoon.

77
00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:16.942
Do you charge a lot? I like your voice. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have a guitar or anything.

78
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.279
I just loved it.

79
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.571
So, what’s the deal here?

80
00:05:22.412 --> 00:05:25.467
Give me your mobile number so we can keep in touch.
— Yeah?

81
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.214
— Of course, and I’ll give you mine.
— Okay.

82
00:05:28.874 --> 00:05:30.720
Bye! Bravo!
PAJARITO: Bye bye, farewell…

83
00:05:31.053 --> 00:05:33.441
PAJARITO:
Music, movies, videos…

84
00:05:35.643 --> 00:05:37.593
Music, movies…

85
00:05:40.085 --> 00:05:48.000
One video is not enough to know all the facets of Pajarito. There's more ! Look for him in other streets !
