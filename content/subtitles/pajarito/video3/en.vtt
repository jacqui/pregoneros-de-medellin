PAJARITO:
After being out all day, I listen to Memo Angel’s show,

2
00:00:23.318 --> 00:00:26.959
or the music one. When I get home early, I listen to <i>Efemérides</i>,

3
00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:29.716
which helps me relax.

4
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:53.653
RADIO:
<i>Literature to listen. Spoken texts, stories, tales, and narrations.

5
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.070
<i>A writer is not a jukebox.

6
00:00:57.947 --> 00:01:02.394
<i>A writer’s first objective is not “to have opinions”, but “to speak the truth”.

7
00:01:02.947 --> 00:01:07.342
<i>My own point of view is that if I have to pick between truth and justice...

8
00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:09.872
<i>—of course I don’t want to pick between them—

9
00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:11.844
<i>I choose the truth.

10
00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:14.675
PAJARITO:
The part I enjoyed the most of the show was when it goes...

11
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.432
“No matter what, there is always something more.”

12
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:19.870
That means beyond these walls, there’s always something more.

13
00:01:20.203 --> 00:01:23.793
Beyond Saturn, there’s more. There’s more beyond me.

14
00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.082
That means there’s such thing as the infinite.

15
00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:34.024
Infinite is inside of me, and outside of me as well. I mean…
Nothing is static.

16
00:01:34.357 --> 00:01:38.254
Everything is movement, everything moves.

17
00:01:38.587 --> 00:01:42.553
Look, it’s raining. So, I imagine the raindrops falling.

18
00:01:50.947 --> 00:01:52.639
When God closes a door, he opens a window.

19
00:01:52.972 --> 00:01:57.331
I mean, because loneliness has also taught me many things: like...

20
00:01:57.664 --> 00:02:01.664
facing life with more integrity, knowing that here I don’t…I am very proud.

21
00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:06.515
Proud like…yeah, it’s like pride: Sometimes I am in need, and I don’t go bothering anyone.

22
00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:13.095
Instead I quietly solve my problems on my own.

23
00:02:13.428 --> 00:02:17.680
I don’t cry much. A tear comes out every now and then…

24
00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:22.203
Having your own home-I had a house, and the UPAC took it away.

25
00:02:22.536 --> 00:02:26.997
But I can’t be all like “Oh, poor me, an old man living alone…” No.

26
00:02:27.587 --> 00:02:29.277
It’s normal. Those things happen.

27
00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.743
PAJARITO:
Well you get lots of frustrations in life.

28
00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:45.931
For example, I wanted to take everything in. That was my…let’s not say “mistake”,

29
00:02:46.264 --> 00:02:49.992
I don’t like the word “mistake”, I don’t like the word “coincidence”.

30
00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:54.983
I like the word “causality”. So, I wanted to be the greatest boxer,

31
00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:58.969
I wanted to be the best soccer player, the best basketball player,

32
00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:02.046
the greatest athlete. I even won three trophies.

33
00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.896
But then…I wanted to be the best singer: I won a singing contest.

34
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:12.866
And so on. But I couldn’t. So now I have this. The last card left.

35
00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.174
PAJARITO:
As said by Ernest Hemingway: “Man can be destroyed, but never defeated..."

36
00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:30.763
"...Because man was not born to be defeated.”

37
00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:35.046
You’re like…But you stay in combat, you stay there.

38
00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.652
There will be hard days, when nothing works, but it works.

39
00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:44.875
When it’s over, at night, you review your day, and the combat was not so…

40
00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:53.445
…it wasn’t so lost. You just had to be smart, wise…many things.

41
00:03:53.778 --> 00:03:58.522
A little spice, many times, that the rival wasn’t even that powerful.

42
00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:02.593
It was yourself, being a coward.

43
00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:07.877
Fears, things…no, keep going.

44
00:04:20.317 --> 00:04:23.612
<i>They say that travelling those roads…

45
00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:28.471
<i>…one day the wheel will wear out from spinning…

46
00:04:29.548 --> 00:04:38.197
<i>…I roll down these roads, and my love for you never fades or wears out.

47
00:04:38.548 --> 00:04:41.778
<i>They say that travelling those roads…

48
00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:46.781
<i>…one day the wheel will wear out from spinning…

49
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:56.794
<i>…I roll down these roads, and my love for you never fades or wears out.

50
00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:58.794
