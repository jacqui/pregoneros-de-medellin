PAJARITO:
Look, I was born in a farmhouse. In the middle of a storm.

2
00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:17.307
I was born in the countryside.

3
00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:25.296
I’ve always liked the sunrise, the air, the moon, the stars, the constellations,

4
00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:29.901
the grass, the water, the air, the elements.

5
00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:48.233
My parents sort of abandoned me.

6
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.146
We were very poor. We were poor!

7
00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:56.679
My teacher was fond of me, so she told my parents: “Leave the kid with me”.

8
00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.568
And this teacher sort of adopted me: she gave me the schoolbooks...

9
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:04.549
...and said “I’ll pay for his studies, so he can keep me company.”

10
00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:09.323
But she was 38, and I was eleven, and...

11
00:01:09.656 --> 00:01:14.036
...I’ve always had great imagination, so, I was like “show me, show me”

12
00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.434
and she was like “No, turn the lights off”. So, I turned the lights off and I touched her. I touched her.

13
00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:23.418
And she said, “No, you can’t do that”, and I was like “C’mon, let me…” with my innocence…

14
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:26.542
And well, one thing led to another.

15
00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:31.268
We made love. And love made us.

16
00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:41.576
Yes, that teacher opened two books for me: The book of women, and literature.

17
00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.248
I love literature. Love it.

18
00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:04.148
I watch people in the train, for example.

19
00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:08.192
They go distracted with their headphones, with their mobiles…

20
00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:11.713
Technology is good and all, but you gotta know how to use it as well.

21
00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:16.233
Not getting so distracted by it and neglecting other things that…

22
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.467
…things that are inside of us.

23
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.735
Things so unfathomable, that they’re waiting for us to bring them to the surface:

24
00:02:28.068 --> 00:02:32.156
those things are values, principles…Many divine things that God has given to us,

25
00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.969
but that we keep hidden because we’re so distracted, like an anthill: we’re all over the place...

26
00:02:36.302 --> 00:02:41.068
...and then we’re like “how is it that I can sleep, play soccer, work…and never take a break?”

27
00:02:58.156 --> 00:03:06.892
Sometimes I hike and I concentrate: I get inside a tree and I flow through the plant’s sap,

28
00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:10.451
from the ground, and then I go all the way to the tree top, to the flowers…

29
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.957
…It’s a beautiful journey.

30
00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:18.977
I feel happy.

31
00:03:19.892 --> 00:03:24.387
Now that I quit drugs, now that I quit many things that…

32
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.694
…violence, fighting…many things…

33
00:03:27.027 --> 00:03:33.848
And that’s life: the footprints I left yesterday have been erased by the wind and the rain.

34
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.131
Life’s not a lament: life is a song.

35
00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:41.613
Look, at five in the morning I haven’t seen a little bird
begging for money, I’ve seen it singing…

36
00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:47.694
That’s beautiful, so, you say “Why don’t I follow this animal’s example?”

37
00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.925
I mean, you unconsciously say “If this animal sings, I sing as well."

38
00:03:51.258 --> 00:03:54.464
And I start singing: <i>Cheers for life, cheers for life.

39
00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:58.694
<i>Cheers for life, live love. Cheers for life and women,

40
00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:01.945
<i>for they’re the best there is in this world!

41
00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:40.071
