00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.202
JALE:
Well, as it turns out, I’m a victim from the floods in <i>La Iguaná,

2
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.000
since 1988, so…I used to have a photo album with all my family, all my children,

3
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.002
and the flood took everything. All of it was lost in the storm.

4
00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:19.000
Now I just have these little memories of them.

5
00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:23.072
This is my eldest, Silvia Iris,

6
00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:25.297
this is Luis Guillermo,

7
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.902
and this is Diego Alejandro.

8
00:01:29.402 --> 00:01:35.993
When he was little, he…he thought what I did was awful,

9
00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:39.928
what I shouted in the street, because I said,

10
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:43.777
I shouted “here comes the black lady with the white, powdery thingy”.

11
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.233
Well, you know kids don’t get it. And one time I took him to get a haircut,

12
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.981
and I was waiting for our turn,

13
00:01:52.314 --> 00:01:57.446
when the kids came and they were like “<i>Jale</i>, <i>Jale</i>, here’s <i>Jale</i>!”

14
00:01:57.446 --> 00:02:00.493
And they were all happy, and they kissed me,

15
00:02:00.493 --> 00:02:04.733
and they asked him “Diego, is <i>Jale</i> your mom?”

16
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.499
And he goes “No, she’s my aunt”.

17
00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:13.263
When he said that, I felt the earth opening up and swallowing me,

18
00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:21.033
because I said “My God, I support my kids with this, I support my family with this, I provide for my home with this."

19
00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:26.583
"And this kid’s denying who I am. I work so hard to support them…”

20
00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:31.271
And, well…I said “I’m not paying attention to this”.

21
00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:36.591
JALE:
People in the street ask me “You don’t have any problems, <i>Jale</i>, do you?”

22
00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:38.511
“You don’t feel a thing, right?”

23
00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:42.938
“You laugh all the time, you dance all the time, you shout all the time…”

24
00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:46.734
But the pain goes inside, sweetie. The pain goes inside.

25
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:49.883
Because if we all cry, who’s gonna comfort us?

26
00:02:54.471 --> 00:03:00.671
JALE:
My only worry…among so many.

27
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:05.953
Because all of us have worries. We all have problems, like they say.

28
00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:12.678
But my main worry, most importantly, is what’s going to happen once I’m old.

29
00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:18.824
When my body stops being able to do anything, not even shouting.

30
00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:24.104
No more black lady with the white thingy, or black, or purple.

31
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.271
Only with the tired thingy.

32
00:03:36.804 --> 00:03:40.419
JALE:
That’s difficult. Very difficult. Work is hard.

33
00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:48.162
Very hard, because this is a…I tell you, just like you have a good time in the street and all,

34
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:54.343
I honestly tell you this is exhausting as hell.

35
00:03:54.343 --> 00:04:00.280
But you live from this anyways, so you gotta step up.

36
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:11.931
JALE:
The day we don’t work, we don’t earn anything.

37
00:04:13.434 --> 00:04:18.000
So, we don’t have the joy of taking vacations.

38
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.811
I mean, if we don’t work one thing we have to work the other.

39
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.830
I wish God gave me the joy of travelling a few days,

40
00:04:31.196 --> 00:04:36.246
seeing other places, seeing other cultures,

41
00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:39.980
meeting other salesmen, other people.

42
00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:42.447
I would be the happiest woman in this world.

43
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.980
But well, those are things that stay in your thoughts.

44
00:04:48.313 --> 00:04:52.000
It’s not like it can’t happen, someday it could. Right?

45
00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:55.716
But okay, those are dreams, and dreaming doesn’t cost a thing…
