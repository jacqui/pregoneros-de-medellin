00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Oh my God

2
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.100
I’m so tired.

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Exhausted.

4
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.000
I can barely lift this now

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Eighteen years carrying a tray on my head…

6
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.423
Stop son, stop, stop!

7
00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.154
Go, go, I’ll…

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.329
Hey people, here comes the black lady with the white powdery stuff!

9
00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.329
Hey, my people!

10

<i>Dry tamarind loses its leaves…</i>
[Melody from popular song]

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
<i>Eat gelatin, they’re freshly made

12
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
<i>Eat gelatin, they’re freshly made

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.599
<i>Eat gelatin, they’re freshly made

14
00:01:07.932 --> 00:01:10.878
JALE:
Hey people! Let’s eat!

15
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.290
JALE:
1200 pesos.

16
00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:30.996
From the roots, from the roots!

17
00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.977
The only black lady with a white thingy in this country!

18
00:01:36.977 --> 00:01:39.795
MAN: <i>Be quiet, lady!</i>
— Pay my bills!

19
00:01:43.393 --> 00:01:45.000
When I lose my voice,

20
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.518
people tell me “go home <i>Jale</i>, ‘cause your working tool’s broken”

21
00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:54.712
And my tool is my voice, because if I don’t shout, I do nothing.

22
00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.143
Nothing because nobody…actually, when I’m quiet,

23
00:01:59.476 --> 00:02:04.657
people say “Shout, shout, because if you don’t shout…you’re dead”

24
00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:08.576
Coroncoro <i>your auntie died, let her go</i>
[Melody from popular song]

25
00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.576
Coroncoro <i>the gelatin is here, let it come

26
00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:18.647
<i>...Coroncoro...

27
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.191
It’s 600 pesos

28
00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:29.239
<i>Jale</i>! With Redín...
[Soccer Player]

29
00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:31.779
Medellín [Soccer Team] will lose ‘til the end!

30
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.776
JALE:
I don’t know how much I walk a day, but it’s a lot.

31
00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.937
— How many, honey?
— Two

32
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.651
— The 600 pesos ones? Or the 3000 ones?
— The black ones

33
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:45.642
The black ones…

34
00:02:45.642 --> 00:02:49.728
JALE:
Because I walk all the way to <i>La Estrella</i>, <i>Itagüí</i>…

35
00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:55.534
It’s like, when you walk around selling…

36
00:02:56.376 --> 00:03:00.599
…time flies. But eventually you feel a little agitated.

37
00:03:01.756 --> 00:03:03.828
JALE:
Honey, here’s the money.

38
00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:07.655
Tell mommy she owes me 200 pesos, because it’s 1200 pesos

39
00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:12.128
JALE:
Sometimes it’s happened that, I went,

40
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.133
and sometimes the business was so bad, everything was so hard,

41
00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:20.655
that I felt like throwing that tray away.

42
00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:25.752
But I thought: this is what I live of, I support my family with this,

43
00:03:25.752 --> 00:03:29.328
I support my kids with this, I support myself with this,

44
00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:34.853
so I put the tray on again and I kept walking, shouting, and working.

45
00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:39.075
Why? Because you should thank God instead,

46
00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:42.974
because even if it’s just this, you’re doing something.

47
00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:50.795
JALE:
[Melody from popular song]
<i>If only you knew how good these gelatins are...Buy them!

48
00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:58.190
<i>If only you knew how good these gelatins are, buy them!

49
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.855
WOMAN:
You see people looking out their windows, laughing,

50
00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:06.875
listening to the songs she makes up.

51
00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:10.475
She’s amazing. Coming up with all those songs…

52
00:04:10.808 --> 00:04:15.475
But it’s all due to her gelatins, she doesn’t name anything. Excellent.

53
00:04:15.808 --> 00:04:19.050
JALE:
[Melody from popular song]
Ras tas tas, <i>move over there

54
00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:22.197
Ras tas tas, <i>come over here

55
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.450
Ras tas tas, <i>come over here

56
00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:30.305
Ras tas tas, <i>move over there!

57
00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.950
JALE:
When you come closer to home you notice you’re tired, right?

58
00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:47.413
But not because you don’t have any problems, it’s just that you--all of us have problems.

59
00:04:47.413 --> 00:04:52.850
Right? But you gotta enjoy life anyways! You gotta enjoy it, because problems,

60
00:04:53.183 --> 00:04:59.300
they’ll show up everyday, they’ll be there, but life goes on.

61
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.930
Am I right?

62
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.430
And when I don’t bring gelatins back, they’re gone.

63
00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.930
So <i>they’re gone, they’re gone all right,

64
00:05:07.263 --> 00:05:10.084
<i>they’re gone, they’re gone all right, they’re gone.
