00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:16.168
What else will it be, <i>Jale</i>?

2
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.337
JALE:
Give me another pound of chuck, please.

3
00:00:19.337 --> 00:00:20.441
Another one of chuck?

4
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.254
JALE:
Due to our economic situation we lived in a zone that wasn't apt...

5
00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:39.613
to raise the children. Because the river was right there,

6
00:00:39.613 --> 00:00:43.626
so it was full of mosquitoes and it was very cold.

7
00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:49.713
So, because of that, they caught bronchopneumonia and pneumonia.

8
00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:51.283
The children.

9
00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:57.000
I lost four children in that time, due to pre-eclampsia,

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.253
so the doctors told me that if the children were born alive,

11
00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:10.770
that if they saved the baby, I died, or all the way around: If I died, the baby got saved.

12
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.443
And in case both of us made it through the birth,

13
00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:17.451
the baby wouldn’t last more than four months.

14
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:21.000
And so it happened, four months later they died.

15
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.957
And three months old as well. There was one.

16
00:01:24.513 --> 00:01:25.752
Oh no.

17
00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:30.611
That’s very hard, <i>Jale</i>, losing a baby that young.

18
00:01:33.013 --> 00:01:39.821
If such a young baby hurts that much, how would it be if it was an older one, right?

19
00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:44.053
— Oh, he’s pissed, he’s pissed.
— He’s hungry.

20
00:01:44.386 --> 00:01:46.796
— Give him the pacifier, the pacifier.
— Where is it?

21
00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:49.472
I think they didn’t bring it, I don’t know.

22
00:01:51.253 --> 00:01:54.703
—They didn’t bring it…?
— Who has Jerónimo’s pacifier!?

23
00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:12.590
WOMAN:
Finally!

24
00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:17.257
— Come, come.
— How's it goin'?

25
00:02:17.257 --> 00:02:18.998
This is my other sister.

26
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.816
When my babies died…

27
00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.621
Back in Chocó they have this custom...

28
00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.305
...because children don’t have any sins...

29
00:02:37.638 --> 00:02:40.219
People do a <i>Gualí</i>.

30
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.763
<i>Gualí</i> means we sing and dance for the kids while they are in their little coffin.

31
00:02:48.763 --> 00:02:53.562
In the little coffin, like this, and it’s like a dance,

32
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.198
to cradle the baby, even if they’re dead.

33
00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:05.784
LADY:
The ones that sang were not the parents, not the ones mourning.

34
00:03:06.117 --> 00:03:12.356
The mourners were crying, and the rest were singing, and dancing.

35
00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:18.498
Because…you let them because the baby’s dead, and that way they’re supposed to go to Heaven,

36
00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:21.530
and they don’t carry any sins. So they say.

37
00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:26.935
And the reason for this is joy, because the baby goes to Heaven.

38
00:03:27.898 --> 00:03:29.000
I don’t know.

39
00:03:49.298 --> 00:03:57.850
WOMAN:
I’ve always told her: “Sister, always keep going. Never give up. Always keep going.”

40
00:03:58.635 --> 00:04:01.125
And she always says “The same goes to you, sister.”

41
00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:04.950
We have always understood each other. Always, always.

42
00:04:05.283 --> 00:04:07.114
I admire her work.

43
00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:13.867
— I admire it. And I respect her. I respect her.
— And I feel proud of her. Proud of her.

44
00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:13.597
Play some music!
