00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.699
GAUCHO:
I should move all this stuff before painting the walls,

2
00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:26.899
because there’s lots of dust, and on the other hand

3
00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:31.357
because my wife and my daughter are
getting sick with all the dust.

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.054
I have to paint, so they stop being sick,

5
00:00:36.387 --> 00:00:38.464
and also in order to have a nice wall.

6
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.054
— And the cap; the other one.
JULIET: What cap?

7
00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:54.224
It’ll get ruined with all the paint

8
00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:59.076
— I don’t know where the cap is
— Ask her if she looked for my brown cap

9
00:01:05.554 --> 00:01:09.378
JULIA:
They always ask, you see? They always ask.

10
00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:11.624
— My cap…
JULIET: Should I bring the brushes?

11
00:01:16.554 --> 00:01:18.157
JULIET:
How many did you buy?

12
00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.019
GAUCHO:
One

13
00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:23.686
— One…?
JULIA: We had a black one, where is it?

14
00:01:36.854 --> 00:01:39.454
Bring another bucket, we’ll fill it with paint...

15
00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:41.747
...so you can help me with the other side of the wall.

16
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.922
This paint is nice…

17
00:01:53.954 --> 00:01:55.711
GAUCHO: Hey, Julia
— Yeah?

18
00:01:56.044 --> 00:02:02.554
— You say that every job I get…You tell me not to do it.
— Yeah.

19
00:02:02.887 --> 00:02:08.078
But it turns out that the jobs…you have to experiment first.

20
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:11.554
You have to try it, to see if the job works for you.

21
00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:16.271
Because if you don’t try, how are you gonna know
whether the job...

22
00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:19.635
...was going to work, give revenue, or not?

23
00:02:19.968 --> 00:02:21.844
You have to try it first.

24
00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:27.122
JULIA: That’s true.
— If you try it and it doesn’t work, well okay, but you tried.

25
00:02:27.644 --> 00:02:32.344
But if you say “Don’t do that, it won’t work” right away…

26
00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:38.744
…No, you can’t jinx it for the other person.

27
00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:43.954
— But…what I’m saying is that you can’t call names,
like “Jinxy”, no. Right?

28
00:02:44.287 --> 00:02:47.288
GAUCHO: Yeah, but you can’t jinx people
— You can’t mistreat people

29
00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:51.139
GAUCHO: You can’t jinx people
— That’s not what giving advice is about.

30
00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:56.986
But yeah, I tell you guys that I’m doing an experiment,

31
00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.060
and that if it works, that’s the job I’m gonna keep…

32
00:03:01.393 --> 00:03:04.650
But if it doesn’t work, why would I keep doing it?
It just didn’t work.

33
00:03:06.168 --> 00:03:13.163
JULIA:
I would like him to be more obedient, and to listen to me
when I talk to him…

34
00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:16.624
…because he’s really stubborn.

35
00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:26.820
JULIA:
This house belongs to Orlando’s mother,

36
00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:31.218
because she hasn't divided the property deed just yet,

37
00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:33.801
and due to this, all the bills are to her name.

38
00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:37.174
That means the house is borrowed.

39
00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:43.093
GAUCHO:
I’ll work, get a piece of land, and build a house from the roots.

40
00:03:44.468 --> 00:03:47.987
It’ll have its property deed, and there’ll be no problem.

41
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.550
JULIA:
Having your own house doesn’t mean you’re rich,

42
00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:52.909
but not owning one makes you poor.

43
00:04:20.668 --> 00:04:23.968
This aloe absorbs bad energy.

44
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:28.227
When it gets wrinkles or becomes mushy,

45
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.968
it’s because it has picked up bad energies, and you have to

46
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:33.238
throw it away into running water.

47
00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:46.302
Julia, the frame...

48
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.866
GAUCHO:
It looks nice.

49
00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.199
JULIA:
It looks good…

50
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.493
GAUCHO: I like the color
— The color is pretty.

51
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:06.599
— Should it touch the wall, or should I leave a gap like this?
— Like that.

52
00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:26.701
