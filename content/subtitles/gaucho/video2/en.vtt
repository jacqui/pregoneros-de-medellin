00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:07.300
Are you taking the pot in there?

2
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.450
Hold this here; don’t let it fall.

3
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.961
GAUCHO:
Today we’re here on a holiday and I’ll take this opportunity
to experiment with sweet rice,

4
00:00:45.294 --> 00:00:49.086
to make it, sell it, and see if it sales.

5
00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.100
If it does, I’ll make some every holiday weekend
and I’ll keep selling it.

6
00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:58.416
If it doesn’t, at least I tried.

7
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.988
See, this is my wife. Her name is Julia Esther.

8
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:13.842
That girl over there is my daughter, the one with
the colorful umbrella.

9
00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:19.095
Juliet, let us see you.

10
00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:24.769
And the other girl is a family friend. Her name is Ana.

11
00:01:30.994 --> 00:01:32.654
JULIET:
A little bit of that.

12
00:01:43.928 --> 00:01:46.628
JULIA:
I’ll give you an advice: whenever you start a business,

13
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:48.262
think hard about what you’re gonna do.

14
00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:55.476
GAUCHO:
I would, but…yeah, with a small basis so I don’t lose much,

15
00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:57.628
but enough to experiment. I experiment first,

16
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:00.954
and if I see that it works, I keep it.

17
00:02:03.028 --> 00:02:06.128
JULIET:
As his family, we shouldn’t tell him it’s not going to work out,

18
00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:08.128
we should say it is going to work out.

19
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:12.936
And if it doesn’t go well, just keep supporting him
with whatever he thinks.

20
00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.561
Because sometimes your ideas are good and sometimes they’re bad.

21
00:02:16.894 --> 00:02:18.495
If it doesn’t work out, well, something else will come up.

22
00:02:18.928 --> 00:02:20.955
God is always with us.

23
00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:35.429
GAUCHO:
Where are the good sales around here?

24
00:02:35.762 --> 00:02:38.686
MAN: The thing is, not many people come on Saturdays.

25
00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.628
Usually it’s on Sundays when lots of people come.
— What about Mondays?

26
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.656
— If it’s a holiday, yeah, many people come.
MAN: You should come on Sunday. Lots of people.

27
00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.028
— Yeah…Okay, but anyways…
— Tomorrow’s selling day.

28
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:51.733
JULIA: Offer some to them.
— I have to make the experiment.

29
00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:53.634
— Tomorrow is a good day.
— Yeah.

30
00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:55.028
MAN: Sunday and…
— Tomorrow and Monday.

31
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:57.071
MAN: …Holiday Monday
— Yeah.

32
00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:04.554
ANA:
The water’s ice cold!

33

MAN: Listen to him.
GAUCHO: This one has more.

50
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.569
MAN:
We have to get the most abundant one,

51
00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:38.417
you know we’re on a terrible drought, so…
GAUCHO: Yes, that’s true.

52
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.217
— Whatever is most abundant. The rice.
MAN: How much is the rice?

53

— Without taxes? No.

56
00:04:48.575 --> 00:04:53.417
GAUCHO:
I was in the other patch, and it was noisy. So, when I shouted...

57
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.272
...nobody could hear and I didn’t sell much.

58
00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:59.314
Buy them now before they go! 2.000 pesos!

59
00:04:59.647 --> 00:05:01.330
GAUCHO:
2.000 pesos, 2.000 pesos!

60
00:05:01.663 --> 00:05:03.672
GAUCHO:
I came to this patch, and I started shouting,

61
00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:06.017
and since there’s not much noise, sales are faster.

62
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.017
GAUCHO:
2.000 pesos, son. Be careful.
