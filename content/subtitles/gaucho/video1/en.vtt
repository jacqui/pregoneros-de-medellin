GAUCHO:
This sweet, the Argentinian <i>Gaucho</i>, is a traditional sweet.

2
00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:30.860
Not many people sell them now,

3
00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:36.052
because actually the ones who used to sell <i>Gaucho</i> are long dead.

4
00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:41.803
So, those who sell it…no, there are very few people who sell these.

00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:46.497
GAUCHO: [Rhyming]
Gaucho<i> for eating!

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.660
<i>Here’s some smooth</i> Gaucho, <i>take it to Rave, jump on the ship, get the hint!

7
00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.706
<i>There’s </i>Gaucho <i>for the girl, for the girl and for the toothless one.

8
00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.167
<i>For both girls: the ones with the dolls.

9
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.700
Smooth <i>Gaucho</i>, for eating!

10
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:08.398
<i>Here’s some</i> Gaucho, <i>I go walking, I keep introducing myself: the name’s Orlando.

11
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:11.552
<i>Keep on buying, I’m not trafficking!

12
00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:15.860
<i>Here’s some </i>Gaucho, <i>Mrs. Marina, these contain lots of aniline,

13
00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:20.398
<i>and also this </i>clemor<i> so you can buy them with humor.

14
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.598
<i>Little </i>Gauchos <i>with vanilla essence, you can eat them and share with Asprilla.

15
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.502
<i>They taste smooth, just like a rave, jump on the ship and get the hint.

16
00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:32.783
GAUCHO: [Rhyming]
<i>For Camila, don’t swing on the Manila or hang yourself with a gorilla.

17
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:35.167
— Give me two
GIRL: I’ll have the pink one, please

18
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.014
GAUCHO: This one is piña colada and bubblegum
— Piña colada and bubblegum

19
00:01:38.347 --> 00:01:39.347
— This one is watermelon

20
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.424
BOY: Give me the…
— What other flavors do you have?

21
00:01:42.757 --> 00:01:45.898
GAUCHO: I have banana, and I have piña colada…

22
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.498
…That one is piña colada and bubblegum.

23
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:49.435
GIRL: Thank you. Let’s go.
— You’re welcome.

24
00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:53.098
GAUCHO: [Rhyming]
<i>Relaxing</i> Gaucho, <i>it won’t knock down your front teeth,

25
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:57.671
<i>like it did to the lover and to Bustamante, whose teeth it’ll knock next year.

26
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:03.537
GAUCHO:
Some people ask “How do you come up with all that, on such short notice?”

27
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.326
And I say “I imagine the words, and they come out instantly from my own authorship.”

28
00:02:21.198 --> 00:02:26.252
They say “You’re an excellent salesman, brother, you can sell anything”.

29
00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:29.106
That’s what they say.
LADY: Shout one for Milena!

30
00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:32.498
Who?
LADY: Shout one for Milena!

31
00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:35.498
[Rhyming]
<i>The girl eats them, and Milena eats them. You buy them from me

32
00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:39.553
<i>and you don’t get poisoned, so buy some of these for the cat with no antenna.

33
00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:59.555
<i>Gaucho</i> for eating!

34
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.131
Give the artist some love. This is good <i>Gaucho</i>.

35
00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:07.206
When I was studying as a kid…I was in primary school I think…

36
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:14.204
I was in first grade, second grade…I was in third grade, in primary school...

37
00:03:15.231 --> 00:03:19.917
...when my old man said: “Well, son, start making some money.”

38
00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:25.966
And I said “Okay dad…will do.”
KID: One for the kid with the glasses!

39
00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.764
GAUCHO: [Rhyming]
<i>For the tall girls and the short girls, also for the maids.

40
00:03:30.097 --> 00:03:32.564
<i>Buy many for the kid with the glasses!

41
00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:37.464
— One for Jaime, one for Jaime!
— <i>The girl eats them, and </i>Jaimito <i>eats them.

42
00:03:37.797 --> 00:03:39.464
<i>You buy it from me, and you buy it quickly,

43
00:03:39.797 --> 00:03:41.989
<i>so the little devil doesn’t come and steal it.

44
00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.478
KID: One for Sandra! …

45
00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:46.864
GAUCHO: [Rhyming]
<i>The girl eats them, and the first one eats them. The chubby kid eats them,

46
00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:50.264
<i>and also the lottery lady. Come out quickly, I’m outside,

47
00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.974
<i>now you can eat with the foreign broad.

48
00:03:53.764 --> 00:03:58.041
<i>Here’s some </i>Gaucho <i>for Norbey, you can eat and share with the ox,

49
00:03:58.374 --> 00:04:00.997
<i>with Shirley, and with the gay kid.

50
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.118
GAUCHO:
With the jobs I’ve been able to have, I’ve done many things.

51
00:04:05.497 --> 00:04:09.404
But I haven’t been able to adjust to any job yet.

52
00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:15.197
I’ll wait for the next job that comes, and see if I can adjust to it

53
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.394
and have a good season, so I can keep that job.

54
00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:38.959
GAUCHO:
I’ve been working since I was eight, selling ice lollies, cigarettes,

55
00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:45.518
shining shoes, recycling, parking cars…I’ve worked selling empanadas,

56
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.327
potatoes, milk, and washing machines. I also worked selling <i>obleas</i>,

57
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.085
and lately it’s <i>Gaucho</i>.

58
00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:22.000
One video is not enough to know all the facets of Gaucho. There's more ! Look for him in other streets !
