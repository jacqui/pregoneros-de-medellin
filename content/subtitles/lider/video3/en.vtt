00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:08.922
Okay, let me take you to my house.

2
00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:14.176
The most beautiful house in the world, I love it so much.

3
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.607
It’s a blessing from God.

4
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.199
PAOLA:
How did you do at the Doctor’s?

5
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:28.725
Sweetie it went well…

6
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.500
I’m a little afflicted because I have an eye infection.

7
00:00:33.832 --> 00:00:39.000
I have some kind of ulcer. I thought it was cataracts, but the Doctor says no.

8
00:00:39.332 --> 00:00:45.347
—So you have to get surgery?
—Yeah, well he said I have to wait for the call...

9
00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:47.801
...to transfer me to Envigado.

10
00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:52.732
Because really, being sick is not good…

11
00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:54.237
you feel…

12
00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:58.878
I feel bad because I have to work.

13
00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:01.814
And...

14
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.271
And if I’m sick I can’t work.

15
00:01:07.604 --> 00:01:08.718
I have to stop.

16
00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:11.948
So the Doctor said I couldn’t.

17
00:01:12.332 --> 00:01:16.437
He said “First of all you work under the sunlight, you face the sun."

18
00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:20.760
"That’s it, the sun’s affecting you..."

19
00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:28.682
"...and all the dirt and dust in the streets get to your eyes. You won’t get better."

20
00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:32.218
"You must stop for at least five days."

21
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.974
My dad works nonstop.

22
00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.018
My dad doesn’t get time off.

23
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:42.836
It’s like he says, he may be sick, he may be lying in bed with a fever and he won’t stay in bed.

24
00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:49.520
My dad gets up with the fever, coughing, limping, whatever, my dad goes to work.

25
00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:53.788
I’ll tell you this, the responsibility that I have,

26
00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:57.773
that my guts tell me to have, is...

27
00:01:58.757 --> 00:02:02.198
...because I never had a future,

28
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.712
a nice childhood.

29
00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.451
Always suffering,

30
00:02:06.828 --> 00:02:09.098
it was always tough, hard.

31
00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:16.665
I don’t want them to even imagine going through that.

32
00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:19.430
No. That’s why I sacrifice myself.

33
00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:25.703
That’s why I do what I’m doing, for them to have what I didn’t have.

34
00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:29.610
Sometimes, when I studied, they said “Oh, your dad sells <i>mazamorra</i>…”

35
00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:33.338
I said “I’m not ashamed of that, is my dad stealing?"

36
00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.774
"Or is he working with dishonor? No."

37
00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:43.023
"My dad works honorably", and thank God that <i>mazamorra</i> has provided for us:

38
00:02:43.356 --> 00:02:47.503
we have good lives, we don’t go barefoot, we don’t starve,

39
00:02:47.836 --> 00:02:53.903
my sister finished school, I finished, we study what we want,

40
00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:56.422
he gives us all with his effort.

41
00:02:56.755 --> 00:03:01.277
One of my dreams is to meet my family.

42
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.115
Having them by my side.

43
00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:10.603
I even thought these days, and I even told Albenis and my daughter,

44
00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:16.825
I said "If God gives me the chance, I’ll go find them and I’ll leave you guys here."

45
00:03:17.203 --> 00:03:18.685
It’s gonna be my vacation.

46
00:03:20.203 --> 00:03:22.065
It’s gonna be my vacation.

47
00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:50.258
God bless you, honey.

48
00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:52.440
PAOLA:
Amen!

49
00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:56.023
PASTOR:
Okay, we’re going to...

50
00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:01.165
...let our brother <i>Líder</i> come up here...

51
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.391
...and express his gratitude with the Lord,

52
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:16.620
and at the same time greet this beautiful congregation and the visitors accompanying us tonight.

53
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.750
— God bless you brothers. I always give thanks because this Word is good
PEOPLE: Amen!

54
00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:34.150
— Wonderful!
PEOPLE: Amen!

55
00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:38.750
— Because The Word has made us free!
PEOPLE: Amen!

56
00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:41.103
— Totally free!
PEOPLE: Amen

57
00:04:41.436 --> 00:04:45.814
And I’m happy because of this freedom Jesus has given me.

58
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:55.615
Because of the way he has put in me the will to preach The Word in the streets as well.

59
00:04:56.283 --> 00:05:01.323
I deal with about two hundred people a day, and each one of them takes the message.

60
00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:06.823
Short mesage. Take a little <i>mazamorra</i> and some of the Testament too.

61
00:05:07.383 --> 00:05:11.183
But take it. Bless The Lord!
PEOPLE: Amen!

62
00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:14.501
Brothers, there’s a reason for great joy,

63
00:05:14.983 --> 00:05:18.383
because Jesus gives us this opportunity.

64
00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:25.520
So, there’s no other thing to say to God but thank you for everything you’ve done.

65
00:05:25.976 --> 00:05:28.102
Thank you for salvation.

66
00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:35.673
Great One, thank you for this beautiful liberation you have given us.

67
00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:40.833
Thank you Christ, Jesus, for bringing me here.

68
00:05:41.683 --> 00:05:45.936
If it wasn’t for him, my soul would’ve been lost.

69
00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:50.122
LÍDER:
If it wasn’t for the Lord we would all be lost, right?

70
00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:51.883
But here we are!

71
00:05:52.216 --> 00:05:56.383
Because of the greatness and the power of His mercy.

72
00:05:56.716 --> 00:05:59.626
Because of His love toward us.

73
00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.463
God bless you, brothers.
