00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
LÍDER:
I didn’t know my mother. Or my father.

2
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Being a kid…

3
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.600
What I do remember is…

4
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.204
is an aunt. My mother’s sister.

5
00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:35.000
She got me out of the farmhouse.

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I even remember it was nighttime. She stole me.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Without my uncle's consent.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.932
What happened? She took me to a place she lived in, in a <i>comuna</i>,

9
00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:51.637
to a house or an apartment she owned, in Florencia.

10
00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:56.850
She used to leave for work, and she locked me in.

11
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.725
Locked, and she left.

12
00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.601
Can you imagine a kid locked in by himself? That’s a torment.

13
00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:06.897
It’s a torment, It’s a crime.

14
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.558
All I did was stare at the walls and cry.

15
00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:15.000
I yelled “get me out, help me”, and no one would come.

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I would see her and I ran.

17
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I didn’t let her touch me.

18
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But I was little so she grabbed me anyways

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.105
and said “shut up or I’ll kill you”.

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I said “No, don’t do that to me …

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
"…don’t do that to me”

22
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
One day she gave me an opportunity to get out of that house.

23
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.000
She left the door open, and I fled.

24
00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:57.000
I took to the street.

25
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.299
The first thing I said, “Wherever that woman doesn’t find me."

26
00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.000
"I’ll go wherever she can’t find me. I can’t be seen.”

27
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And some kids from the street said “come, let’s go to the alley”.

28
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.300
I didn’t know what alley.

29
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.000
And I couldn’t even walk, and he carried me,

30
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.687
and there they provided their services.

31
00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:26.000
What services do homeless people provide?

32
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Raw plantain, garbage,

33
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
spoiled food, rotten rice,

34
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
bad, wormy meat. I had to eat all of that.

35
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
LÍDER:
I wandered the coasts by truck,

36
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and then I got to Armenia.

37
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.539
And in Armenia I got sick, because of the drugs.

38
00:02:58.872 --> 00:03:01.584
My lung was pierced, and…

39
00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.000
I couldn’t- <i>Líder</i> lost his voice.

40
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Lamentably he lost his voice.

41
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.896
I felt despair, it burned.

42
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:14.800
Something ate me from the inside,

43
00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:17.707
and I started puking blood.

44
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.707
I lost my strength.

45
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.707
I had no strength left.

46
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.985
I couldn’t even see.

47
00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:25.427
I was gonna agonize.

48
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yeah, I thought I was gone.

49
00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:31.911
Someone I don’t know, someone out of nowhere,

50
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:34.245
sees me like that.

51
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.000
And he doesn’t ask, or says anything. He just says:

52
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.990
“In the name of Jesus of Nazareth I command you to get up."

53
00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:51.000
"Because he is Your creation, Lord..."

54
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.699
"...give him a chance to live."

55
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:56.704
"Get him up Jesus Christ, for the love of his name."

56
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.199
I immediately felt, when that man said that,

57
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
something on me like two electric wires going through me…

58
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And it changed.

59
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Immediately, instantly, I felt relief.

60
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.252
And lying there,

61
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.012
because he authorized for me to get up, I got up.

62
00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:25.252
You’re looking at <i>Líder</i>, just a kid.

63
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.848
I looked around and it seemed like a dream.

64
00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:30.461
I said “it’s like I left and came back, or what?”

65
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.630
I looked around, and he held me.

66
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.581
He was an old man with white hair.

67
00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.230
And he said: “Are you okay?”

68
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.079
I said “Yes, thank you”.

69
00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:44.110
And he said “Hold on, you’re not done yet”.

70
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.411
We got to the parsonage,

71
00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:49.000
to the temple.

72
00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.417
And he handed me over.

73
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.814
He took me to the pastor and said “I brought you this kid."

74
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
"The Lord acted upon him. Take care of him."

75
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
"He’s in your hands."

76
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
"You’ll be fine here, with him, okay?”

77
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.100
I said “thank you, thank you very much”.

78
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I was speechless.

79
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
LÍDER:
For Your glory, for Your honor,

80
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.000
in this hour oh Lord,

81
00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.000
in front of Your Glorious Throne,

82
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.000
a thousand times thank you.

83
00:05:28.332 --> 00:05:32.071
For allowing me, oh God, invoke Your Name...

84
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.764
...in favor of the human lineage,

85
00:05:36.300 --> 00:55:52.333
oh Lord Jesus Christ. Forever and ever, amen, and amen.
