00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.879
All eat!

2
00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.000
Hey! Come to eat y'all!

3
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.466
Hey!

4
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.779
Hey, come, don't let skinny boy burn!

5
00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:46.936
LÍDER: When doesn't she eat, right?

6
00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:48.474
Oh, cutie!

7
00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:51.000
Okay then, eat y'all!

8
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
All eat!

9
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.000
I'll introduce myself.

10
00:00:59.138 --> 00:01:01.016
My name is <i>Líder</i> [leader].

11
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.585
Always on the lead.

12
00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:05.132
He’s unique,

13
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.059
there’s no one like <i>Líder</i>, he’s the only one.

14
00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:10.861
And <i>Líder</i>…

15
00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:14.432
What <i>Líder</i> does is
being polite,

16
00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:18.922
gentile, special, respectful…

17
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.479
…He has all the good hooks. All of them.

18
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.801
There’s no bad thing in <i>Líder</i>. Just good stuff.

19
00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.221
Come!

20
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.599
You gonna eat, doggie?

21
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.818
Come eat already, y’all!

22
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.554
The money’s on the bag ‘cause skinny boy’s hitting the tides.

23
00:01:53.887 --> 00:01:57.722
We always buy from him because it’s a very special <i>mazamorra</i>, very tasty.

24
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:03.977
—We know him now, “the <i>mazamorra</i>’s coming”, so you come with your…
—You wait for him now

25
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.400
—…with your little pot

26
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:08.284
Mafe hears him, she comes out right away, always.

27
00:02:09.154 --> 00:02:10.285
WOMAN:
Why?

28
00:02:10.618 --> 00:02:14.121
Because she loves his <i>mazamorra</i>. She always comes out, right?

29
00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:15.665
Every time

30
00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:20.255
<i>Mazamorra</i>!
[Boiled corn]

31
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:25.021
Hey, you gonna eat, princess? Of course! Come eat. Come.

32
00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:28.057
Once he steps foot in the neighborhood you hear him right away.

33
00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:34.554
And if you don’t, someone says, “the <i>mazamorra</i> guy’s coming”, so you know he’s coming.

34
00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:35.554


35
00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:38.315
And when he gets to the corner we hear him right away.

36
00:02:39.657 --> 00:02:42.231
Coconut <i>panelita</i>!
[Sugar cane confectionery]

37
00:02:43.057 --> 00:02:48.610
So, I say “okay, you’re all gonna eat. No one’s left without food."

38
00:02:48.957 --> 00:02:51.947
"Even if it’s a little bit, a tiny spoonful, just eat.”

39
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.976
Right? So I came up with “All eat”. Why? Because they…

40
00:02:57.696 --> 00:03:03.213
It’s a product I sell for people to eat. Not to leave it in my pot, but for everyone to eat.

41
00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:08.611
So I get them eating, right? So that’s why I say "hey, all eat!"

42
00:03:09.242 --> 00:03:14.009
They know I’m here. If they’re not hungry, they get hungry.

43
00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:30.270
All eat!
MAN: I have no teeth!

44
00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:40.664
LÍDER:
The thing is, if you don’t shout, people can’t hear you.

45
00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:46.276
And if you do, they hear and they come out.

46
00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:47.876
How much, honey?

47
00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:54.409
So, I gotta shout. Right princess? So you can hear me.

48
00:03:54.742 --> 00:03:57.130
—God bless you.
—Okay honey, God bless you.

49
00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.882
If I shout you hear me, right?

50
00:04:00.215 --> 00:04:04.209
So how does it go? All eat!

51
00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:06.385
All eat!

52
00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.267
—Coconut <i>panelitas</i>!
—Coconut <i>panelitas</i>!

53
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.750
Come eat, y’all!

54
00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:15.858
Come eat, y’all!

55
00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:19.367
Beautiful. Okay, let’s go.

56
00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:23.559
LÍDER:
Shouting is my equipment.

57
00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:32.569
Right? The microphone the Lord gave me. That is, my lungs are the batteries of a megaphone,

58
00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:38.967
that the Lord put inside of me so I can say “all eat!”

59
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.644
Okay? And if it rains they don’t get wet,

60
00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:45.087
or get ruined.

61
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.162
And they keep going.

62
00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:55.991
Morning, day and night, while <i>Líder</i>’s alive, the microphone and megaphone are there, inside of me.

63
00:04:58.202 --> 00:05:00.699
All eat!

64
00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:05.263
All eat!

65
00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:18.163
LÍDER:
See, I don’t need a megaphone or a microphone,

66
00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:21.249
or some device to help me. No.

67
00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:26.363
I have something God gave me inside of me, which are the lungs.

68
00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:30.763
And they’re sharp. Very sharp, you hear?

69
00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:36.051
So, thanks to Him, for this voice. Wanna hear again?

70
00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:58.000
One video is not enough to know all the facets of Líder. There's more ! Look for him in other streets !
