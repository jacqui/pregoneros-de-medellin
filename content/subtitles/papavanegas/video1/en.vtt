CROWD:
Ding ding ding! Hello hello hello!

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:06.299
MAN:
We’re here to inform you that Vanegas has arrived, arrived!

3
00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:10.099
CROWD:
We’re here to inform you that Vanegas has arrived, arrived!

4
00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:16.100
— We were the worst, now we’re the best!
CROWD: We were the worst, now we’re the best!

5
00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:22.100
— Fighting for life, drugs will be defeated!
CROWD: Fighting for life, drugs will be defeated!

6
00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:25.001
— Can we, or can we not!?
CROWD: We can!

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.700
MAN:
We come from the Papá Vanegas Corporation, we don't beg.

8
00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.899
We’re humbly working with these delicious cookies,

9
00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:48.899
to give our support to many young people so they can thrive.

10
00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:51.324
Would you like to help by buying a few?

11
00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:54.700
— How much are they?
— Thank you very much. You see, Papá Vanegas
Corporation is an Institution...

12
00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.500
...where they help people with drug addiction, alcoholism,
delinquency, and housing issues.

13
00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:01.712
If you know someone with these kinds of issues,
-a family member, a friend, a neighbor-,

14
00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:05.754
there’s a label in the wrap with our address and phone number,
so we can help these young people.

15
00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:08.624
Through the chants we deliver messages as well.

16
00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:14.124
We deliver messages that tell people that
we don’t care so much about...

17
00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:17.624
...selling a product, as we do for sending
a message that says we can;

18
00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:20.971
that these people here right now are fighting for their lives,

19
00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:25.624
and also that through this product we are selling,
we’re helping many more.

20
00:01:25.957 --> 00:01:28.524
Because this is something that motivates us so much...

21
00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:32.328
...to let people know who we were, and what we are now.

22
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:37.124
Because we used to be people who didn’t socialize
with the community,

23
00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:40.624
and now through these chants we get in touch with it again,

24
00:01:40.957 --> 00:01:46.733
and our happiness is such, that people can also feel it,
because if we smile,

25
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:52.657
they smile back at us every time, whether they
buy the cookies or not.

26
00:01:53.257 --> 00:01:57.657
— I’m always motivated and happy!
CROWD: I’m always motivated and happy!

32
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.457

CROWD: <i>We can!

33
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.557
Good morning, how are you? I’m sorry to bother you,

34
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.157
my name is Sergio, I come from Papá Vanegas Corporation…

35
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.057
SERGIO:
I came to this place because I was tired of suffering,

36
00:02:33.657 --> 00:02:36.961
because I come from the street. I used to live on the streets...

37
00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:42.327
...I was, and I quote, “a hobo”. I made the decision
to change because...

38
00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:46.877
...I have started two processes here in the Corporation.
I have failed twice.

39
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.442
One of the times I failed I went to jail. I went to jail,
and it changed my life completely.

40
00:02:54.457 --> 00:02:58.057
Being behind bars, being among prisoners is hard.

41
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.020
They are brave; believe me when I say they are fighters.

42
00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:04.870
They are strong, and we have to support them no matter what.

43
00:03:05.657 --> 00:03:08.398
Believe me when I say this. And whenever I am able to,
I do support them.

44
00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:12.957
And I know there are many people who want to.
These young men are nice,

45
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.157
they’re honest, and…I don’t know, they’re just wonderful to me.

46
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.909
I feel proud, and it makes me happy when people
come out their balconies,

47
00:03:22.242 --> 00:03:26.342
applaud us, cheer for us, or look out their windows…

48
00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:32.293
…You know what I mean? So, the chants are
very important to us, in our lives.

49
00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:45.057
— I wake up every morning…
CROWD: I wake up every morning…

ANDERSON:
Delicious cookies for just 2.000 pesos…

55
00:04:06.242 --> 00:04:08.102
Thank you sir for your help.

56
00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:10.622
Here they go my friend…

57
00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:13.946
Have a nice day!

58
00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.346
We’re a group of young people trying to leave drugs and
alcohol behind, honey!

59
00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:20.546
Help us by buying a few cookies! We’re trying to thrive,
2000 pesos, honey!

60
00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:24.346
WOMAN:
I am an alcoholic, and I also spent three months in
La Luz Foundation.

61
00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:28.000
It helped me a lot, and since you’re recording this,
I would like to say...

62
00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:32.546
...to whoever watches this, to keep going, really,
life can’t be wasted.

63
00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:38.346
Drugs are an abyss, they’re like a Mike Tyson you have to keep fighting, so…
— Yes, every day.

64
00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:43.246
…Every day, 24/7…It’s my first year sober this March,
and you can do it,

65
00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:47.942
and the blessings are more, thanks to the Superior Power
and God before all.

66
00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:51.199
How much are they?
— 2000 pesos honey, and God bless you my queen.

67
00:04:51.532 --> 00:04:54.558
We have to keep going, and never give up.

68
00:04:54.891 --> 00:05:03.242
— Never give up. So, keep going, and really, we can do it.
— God bless you, honey. May God repay you, thank you.

69
00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:04.879
Bye, have a nice day.

70
00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:07.979
MAN:
The chants are something I feel inside, a passion.

71
00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:13.404
It’s similar to what you feel for your soccer team,
you go “Oh, Colombia!; Oh, <i>Nacional </i>!”.

72
00:05:13.737 --> 00:05:18.386
It’s the same. This Corporation is <i>super wow</i>   for me,
you know what I mean?

73
00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:22.465
You gotta get the good out of the bad,
and the best out of the good.

74
00:05:22.798 --> 00:05:27.479
Every day is a lesson, and you gotta live each day
as if it was the last.

75
00:05:29.046 --> 00:05:34.046
MAN: <i>I feel capable and certain today!</i>
CROWD: <i>I feel capable and certain today!

One video is not enough to know all the facets of Papavanegas. There's more ! Look for them in other streets !
