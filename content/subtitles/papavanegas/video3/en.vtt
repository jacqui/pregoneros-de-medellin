00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:12.900
HAIRDRESSER:
Before being sure of whom you are,

2
00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.899
they could catch you playing dollhouse
with your mom’s stuff.

3
00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:18.428
Oh yeah.

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Strolling down the block with mom’s purse,
lipstick, mascara… all of her stuff.

5
00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:28.000
— Shit, you were screwed then…!
— You can’t imagine. Yeah, with high heels and all.

6
00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:32.254
—You were so screwed! I did all that, but in my house!
— No, I took a walk around the block...

7
00:00:32.254 --> 00:00:36.160
...And I put a white towel on my purse,
and my name was <i>Topacio</i>…

8
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.799
— Who was <i>Topacio </i>?
— Don’t you remember that soap opera? <i>Topacio </i>?

9
00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:42.100
— I never saw that, I was too young.
— Oh honey, the thing is you’re very young.

10
00:00:42.432 --> 00:00:45.899
MAN: Did your mom ever catch you?
— Well she was working, so…

11
00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:50.399
— So you fooled around with her things while she was out?
— No, I played with the girls from my neighborhood…

12
00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:54.625
…And being so little, people never thought...

13
00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.732
— They didn’t say “Oh he’s a faggot”.
— ...but now that I’m an adult, they see me with boobs...

14
00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:00.340
...and all that stuff and they say “Oh, he was really a faggot”.

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.068
HAIRDRESSER:
Did they ever doubt it?

16
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.500
[We work with bio-security norms.]

17
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:24.001
LADY:
I have lived with Anderson since he was born,

18
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.832
since his mom engendered him, because I was there...

19
00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:29.233
...even through her pregnancy,

20
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:33.832
and we have always lived together in this same block,

21
00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:39.627
not in this house, but in another one
four houses down the block.

22
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:45.805
Well, he’s been reckless, noisy…He’s been restless
since he was born,

23
00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:52.247
very conflictive, but to be honest that’s just
how all kids behave.

24
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.354
He also listened; he let us lead him and everything.

25
00:01:57.687 --> 00:02:03.407
He did go through a rough patch though; he let himself
go deep into drugs.

26
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.988
First he started using marihuana and all that stuff, alcohol…

27
00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:13.401
…and sadly, he started inhaling glue afterwards,

28
00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.039
which ruined all of our lives...

29
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:22.005
...because he made us suffer a lot by being out on the streets

30
00:02:22.338 --> 00:02:25.404
and never coming for food, or to sleep…

31
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.668
He was mistreated on the streets…

32
00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:35.975
…You always felt pain when people came to tell you
“Anderson is over there begging”.

33
00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:40.823
He allegedly begged so he could eat, but those were lies,
he begged to get his vice.

34
00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.239
LADY:
I want to show you, I have pictures from his first birthday party,

35
00:02:56.572 --> 00:02:58.561
also pictures of him older...

36
00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:01.015
…Let’s see…

37
00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.629
This one is him on his first birthday, he was…

38
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.408
…this one is also from his first birthday.

39
00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:17.708
This was on another birthday of his,
or my niece’s birthday,

40
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:21.684
I don’t recall, I just know it was a birthday.
ANDERSON: … In <i>Itagüí </i>.

41
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.862
LADY: Oh, you remember.
ANDERSON: Yeah.

42
00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:30.669
LADY:
I do want to say something: when he was going
through all those bad things,

43
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:34.908
when he let his beard grow and his hair grow…

44
00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:38.408
His hair was so long, he looked like a crazy person,

45
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:42.137
and even his nieces ran from him.

46
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.908
Even Karina here used to say
“Here comes the crazy man, my uncle”

47
00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:50.508
-because they even called him “uncle”-
She said “My uncle’s coming..."

48
00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:54.008
"...he’s acting crazy, he’s crazy!”
And they ran here and hid, and...

49
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:57.607
...they even closed the doors so he couldn’t come inside.

50
00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:02.608
I went along with it, because they were kids
and they did that out of instinct,

51
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:07.396
but it made me really sad, watching them lock him out.

52
00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:14.141
They didn’t understand that he was also a person,
and that he was also family, or any of that…

53
00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:16.241
…They were just scared of the way he looked,

54
00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:22.041
and they just ran from him and locked him out instead.

55
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:29.241
He didn’t even realize what was going on…
— The thing is, with consumption...

56
00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:37.341
...you lose time notion, your values…

57
00:04:37.674 --> 00:04:42.837
…You stop worrying about everything…
You become a non-conscious person.

58
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.908
All you wanna do is consume,

59
00:04:46.808 --> 00:04:53.039
you don’t care what people think or do,
you just wanna do your thing.

60
00:04:53.974 --> 00:05:01.443
But all of that suffering is a test that
the Superior Being, God, puts you through…

61
00:05:01.776 --> 00:05:06.765
And right now we’re dealing with it, because
everything’s about fighting,

62
00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:09.174
and the ones that fight reach their goals…

63
00:05:09.507 --> 00:05:11.793
And the ones that reach their goals, persevere.

64
00:05:11.793 --> 00:05:17.150
