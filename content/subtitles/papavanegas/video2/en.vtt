How are you guys? Good morning.

2
00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:17.766
Good morning Nando, Nacho, Sergio, good morning.

3
00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:21.800
Good morning Anderson.
ANDERSON: Good morning my friend.

4
00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.030
Gentlemen, good morning.

5
00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.000
— Some of you won’t get to shower because in five minutes…
— Get in line.

6
00:00:50.332 --> 00:00:51.600
Excuse me, Eddie.

00:00:51.932 --> 00:00:53.285
Good morning y'all!

22
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:35.233

does not step back. It doesn’t!

25
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.711
Okay, bring the salesmen.

26
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.633
— On it…
— The salesmen.

27
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:55.133
…two minus three.
— Thirty-two minus three, twenty-nine.

28
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:59.314
MAN: Thirty-five. Didn’t you sell any yesterday?
— No.

29
00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:04.033
MAN:
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, ten…

30
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:07.392
MAN:
Ready? Go ahead boy, we love you.

31
00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:15.702
MAN:
I came to this Corporation because, to be honest,
I was a very damaged person.

32
00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:22.571
I hurt a lot of families, specially my own family: my daughter…

33
00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:28.680
I made her suffer a lot. I lost my wife, I lost my business...

34
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:34.044
And I made a choice, because of the drugs.

35
00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:40.292
I said “No, I can’t go on like this. I have lost everything,
but I have my life left. I will fight for it.”

36
00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:45.062
MAN:
Here in this place I found a home.

37
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:48.292
A father. Although there’s no mother, we still have
a mom and dad,

38
00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:50.859
because that man plays both roles at the same time.

39
00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:54.692
Because I've said to him many times: My leader,
don’t let me leave this place,

40
00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:59.483
because I know where I’m going. Tie me up if possible,
my leader, but I won't leave this place.

41
00:03:02.344 --> 00:03:05.582
— Robert, Little Robert…
— God bless you.

42
00:03:06.844 --> 00:03:08.617
God bless you!

43
00:03:09.492 --> 00:03:13.892
Hey, good luck guys, may you sell them all!
God bless you!

44
00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:19.092
<i>“To get those souls out of the abyss, so they can be elevated
and illuminated into a new life full of peace, light, and love.”

45
00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:24.852
ANDERSON:
I am Anderson Guerra, and I am 31 years old.

46
00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:30.518
I came here devastated, in bad shape, famished.

47
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.541
I was in bad, bad shape. I was weighing 43 Kg.

48
00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:43.155
And by the time I got out of the Corporation I weighed 105 Kg.

49
00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:51.625
I started smoking cigarettes when I was nine, then,
when I was 10, I started getting high with marihuana.

50
00:03:51.958 --> 00:04:00.744
Then, successively, I used other things until I was almost 25,
when I started giving it a rest at a Rehab Center.

51
00:04:01.077 --> 00:04:07.925
I think I was 23. It was two years of detox, and then
I went back to another one, and so on.

52
00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:13.041
Anyways, it was more than fifteen years in which I consumed
a bit of everything.

53
00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:18.958
And I felt attacked by my own neighborhood, to the point
that I was going to get killed,

54
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:23.625
and my only exit was a Center or some support,

55
00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:28.425
that could help me become aware of the fact that
I was harming myself.

56
00:04:28.758 --> 00:04:31.625
That’s the reason I found this Corporation, Papá Vanegas,

57
00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:37.630
through another mate that was here with us, and that
is currently on the streets here in Medellín.

58
00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:41.681
He was the first one to tell me “Let’s go to this Corporation”,

59
00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:44.412
and now that I’ve been here for six years,

60
00:04:44.745 --> 00:04:49.958
running into him in the street and hearing him say
“Could you give me some of those cookies..."

61
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:52.244
"...or could you give me 2000 pesos”,

62
00:04:52.635 --> 00:04:57.344
after having been a consumer myself, and knowing that
giving them money is...

63
00:04:57.677 --> 00:05:02.452
...throwing them back into the hole you just came out of,
is just hard.

64
00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:06.205
But, when you set a goal for yourself and you fight,

65
00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:09.058
you thrive, and you accomplish things.

66
00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:13.197
I feel sorry for my mate. His name is Andrés Felipe Rivera.

67
00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:18.286
ANDERSON:
The thing is you can never say you’re ready,

68
00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:21.458
because we have weaknesses, and we’re human beings,

69
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:25.229
so we’ll always have weaknesses.

70
00:05:27.258 --> 00:05:33.932
And having those weaknesses we can never say that
we’re ready and that we’ll never consume again,

71
00:05:34.658 --> 00:05:39.877
because you don’t know. And, as they have taught us
in Therapeutic Community,

72
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.355
it’s all about living the “just for today”.

73
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.299
It’s all about thinking: “just for today,
I won’t consume anymore”.

74
00:05:48.788 --> 00:05:52.707
Why? Because I don’t know what will happen tomorrow,
and the past has passed.

75
00:05:53.297 --> 00:05:57.601
So, yesterday has passed; tomorrow,
I don’t know if I’ll be alive,

76
00:05:57.934 --> 00:06:00.697
or what I’m going to do; only today, when I’m standing,

77
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.850
I’m conscious that today I’m not going to consume anymore.

78
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:15.875
